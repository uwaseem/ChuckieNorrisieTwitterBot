# Chuckie Norrisie Twitter Bot
[@ChuckieNorrisie](https://twitter.com/ChuckieNorrisie) is a twitter bot that tweets random Chuck Norris jokes.

This bot currently does 4 things:
* Tweets a random Chuck Norris joke once every 6 hours
* Replies back with a random Chuck Norris joke when mentioned
* Tweets a specific Chuck Norris joke to new followers
* Replies with a customised joke Chuck Norris to random Twitter users

I'll definitely be adding more capabilities and features, focusing on engagement & interaction with random twitter users soon. Please do share any suggestions that you might have in making this bot more interactive.
